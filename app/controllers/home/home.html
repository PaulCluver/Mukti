	<h4>Hatha</h4>
	<p>Hatha yoga refers to a set of physical exercises and sequences of asanas which are designed to align your skin, muscles, and bones. Hatha is also translated as ha meaning “sun” and tha meaning “moon.” This refers to the balance of masculine aspects—active, hot, sun—and feminine aspects—receptive, cool, moon—within all of us. Hatha yoga is a path toward creating balance and uniting opposites. In our physical bodies we develop a balance of strength and flexibility. We also learn to balance our effort and surrender in each pose.</p>

	<h4>Ashtanga</h4>
	<p>Ashtanga yoga is extremely popular and inspires fierce loyalty in its students. This vigorous, athletic style of practice appeals to those who like a sense of order and who like to do things independently. Ashtanga yoga, also known as “Power yoga” uses a sequence of asanas that are linked with the breath. It generates heat which facilitates flexibility and gives a great sense of wellbeing. The vinyasa or link through flowing movement done between asanas, also gives an uninterrupted continuity or a “moving meditation” as it were.</p>

	<h4>Vinyasa</h4>
	<p>Vinyasa yoga, in which movement is synchronized to the breath, is a term that covers a broad range of yoga classes. This style is sometimes also called flow yoga, because of the smooth way that the poses run together and become like a dance. The breath becomes an important component because the teacher will instruct you to move from one pose to the next on an inhale or an exhale. Vinyasa is literally means "connection," between movement and breath.</p>
